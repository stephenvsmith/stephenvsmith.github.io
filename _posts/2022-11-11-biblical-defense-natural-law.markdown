“There is no real discontinuity between the teaching of the Reformers and that of their predecessors with respect to natural law.” - [John McNeill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._McNeill) (Calvin Scholar; editor for one translation of Calvin’s Institutes)
## Introduction
**Natural Law** - A term which generally refers to the moral order inscribed in the world and especially in human nature, an order that is known to all people through their natural faculties (especially reason and/or conscience) even apart from supernatural divine revelation that binds morally the whole human race (1).
It is God’s law proclaimed by the human heart and conscience (19).
God’s common moral revelation given to all people of whatever religious conviction (38).

# What Natural Law is Not
* Something which detracts from the authority and priority of Scripture
* An attempt to produce an ethics based on human autonomy
* Represent a failure to seriously take into account the fact of human sin and its effect on human reasoning
* An unbending, “monolithic” moral standard that cannot account for the historical development of biblical teaching on ethics

# Central Argument
The reality of natural law is grounded in God’s own nature and the creation of human beings in the divine image, and an appeal to natural law is not an appeal to human autonomy but an appeal to the authority of God the Creator, and we can appeal to natural law while remaining attentive to the fallen nature of humanity and to the historical character of the Bible (4).

## Natural Law and Human Nature
* The reality that humans are made in the image of God means that humans are moral creatures by nature (since God is a moral being), know God’s law, and are commissioned to perform it.
* God has revealed in many ways that he is the sovereign king, including that he is a just judge (Psalm 89:5-7, 14-18; 1 Kings 22:19; Isaiah 6; Revelation 4-5) who makes judicial proclamations over what he made (Gen. 1:4, 9, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31).
* (Ephesians 4:24, Colossians 3:10) Since those who are in Christ are being restored into the image of Christ, we learn that the image of God consisted at least in righteousness, holiness, and knowledge (including moral knowledge)
Humans were commissioned by God to imitate God’s rule in their rule over creation, and the image of God carried along with it a natural law inherent to our nature that would direct us to fulfill our commission in righteousness and holiness.
* Though the corruption that came by sin corrupted man’s natural knowledge of God and morality (Gen. 6:5, Jer. 17:9, Eph. 2:1), natural law continues to exist in a fallen world and Scripture gives many reasons to support its importance.
– (Rom. 1:18-32) The natural law in general revelation confronts every person such that they are inexcusable for a multitude of sins before God because they all know they are sins.
– (Rom. 2:14-15) The requirements of the law are written on the hearts of those who were not given the law, and their consciences render verdicts because human nature itself proclaims this law and judges whether it has been kept.

## Natural Law and the Two Kingdoms Doctrine
**Two Kingdoms** - God is the one and only king who rules the world in two different ways. God governs the “left hand”, or the “civil kingdom”, as its creator and sustainer but not its redeemer. This kingdom pertains to temporal, earthly, provisional matters. God governs the “right hand”, or the “spiritual kingdom”, as not only its creator and sustainer but also as its redeemer in Christ. This kingdom pertains to things of Christ’s heavenly, eschatalogical kingdom.
* The Noahic Covenant in Genesis 9 is a covenant of common grace established with the entire human race, and it is on this covenant that the civil kingdom is established.
* The civil kingdom is established in a sinful world in which temporal affairs of justice, procreation, and cultural development are regulated.
* The spiritual kingdom is established on the Abrahamic covenant, which is only for some, not the entirety of the human race. God separated Abraham and his family from the world by giving them the hope of salvation with a religious sign.
* Unlike with Israel, in the New Covenant was made with an institution, the church, undefined by ethnic and geographical boundaries and without a civil code to direct it as a geopolitical entity.
* In the New Covenant, social life and Christian participation in the world is analogous to the situation with Abraham (Gen. 14, 21:22-24, 23) and the Babylonian exiles (Jer. 29:1-9) as alien strangers.

## Natural Law and the Civil Kingdom
* The civil kingdom is to be a realm in which justice is administered and in which the creation ordinance of filling the earth is pursued (Gen. 4:15; 9:1, 5-7). It is not morally neutral, but is a moral realm under God’s authority as creator and sustainer.
* Rather than appealing to special revelation, God’s people in the Old Testament appealed to a common, natural moral standard when they interacted with others in the civil kingdom.
    * **Things which should not be done** - (Gen. 20) In his interactions with Abraham, Abimelech claims that Abraham did “things to me that should not be done” regarding mistakenly taking Sarah, which manifests some sort of common moral knowledge, standard, and responsibility. Genesis 34 confirms this concept of “things which should not be done”.
    * **Fear of God** (Gen. 20, Ex. 1., Ex. 18, Gen 42:18) - Refers to some sort of decency and propriety among the people of the land that would prevent them from doing a great injustice. It is the sense of accountability to one greater than they which constrains behavior even apart from a redemptive relationship with the true God, but which is of significance in the civil kingdom.
        * Abraham believed he would be killed because there was no fear of God there, and the opposite response implies that there was a fear of God there which constrained their behavior (Gen. 20).
        * It is likely that the midwives of Exodus 1 were in fact Egyptians, though called “Hebrew midwives”, since it is unlikely that Pharaoh would appoint Hebrew women to exterminate Hebrew babies. Also, the slur in v. 19 (the Hebrew women are called “animals”) would be more convincing from Egyptians. These women are called God-fearers for preventing infanticide, though there is no indication that they converted to Israel’s religion or become part of their covenant community. They responded to an authority higher than Pharaoh.
        * (Ex. 18) Jethro provides Moses with advice for Israel’s judicial system, namely that he should share his burden with men who “fear God”, which seems to indicate a sense of accountability that compels judges to take their responsibilities seriously and execute their office with judicial wisdom.
        * (Gen 42:18) Before he reveals himself, Joseph tells his brothers that he fears God, which would assure them that he would not do them any injustice.
    * **Common Humanity** (Job 31:13-15, Amos 1:3-2:3, Gen. 4) - Refers to an acknowledgement of and respect for others as fellow human beings which compels us to abide by important standards for civility and justice in the civil kingdom
        * Job correlates the fear of God with common humanity by acknowledging that he would have to give an account to a higher authority for how he treats other humans, which constrains his behavior. Underlying Job’s words is the assumption of a fundamental equality among all human beings regardless of their social roles and hierarchical relations.
        * (Amos 1:9-10) Amos condemns surrounding nations for their egregious actions. God holds the people of Tyre responsible because they acted contrary to the nature of things. Later, God condemns Judah and Israel, but he does so on the basis of special revelation as his covenant people, rather than with respect to the natural law as with the neighboring nations.
        * (Gen. 4) God gave no explicit rationale when he confronted Cain, and it is apparent that Cain should know that murder is wrong. There is a repetition of “his/your brother” to show from the closeness of the relationship how wicked the murder is.

## Natural Law and the Spiritual Kingdom
* Natural law is important in the spiritual kingdom because this realm involves the renewal of the image of God, which is closely related to natural law.
* The importance of natural law in the spiritual kingdom is first demonstrated by moral instruction given with allusion to the natural world
    * (Proverbs 26:1) Scripture uses common knowledge about the order of nature to highlight the inherent disorder of a certain pattern of behavior
    * (Amos 3:3-8) In this passage, God teaches his people through natural allusions that they have done what is unnatural by refusing to listen to his Word.
    * (Proverbs 6:6-8, 10) Certain ways of acting are so natural or unnatural that animals exhibit them (or don’t).
    * (Isaiah 29:16, Mt. 24:32-33) Jesus and the prophet use natural law arguments to show the disorder of certain behavior or to illuminate teaching.
    * (1 Cor. 11:14-15) Paul appeals to the natural order to strengthen and illuminate his moral exhortations.
* Scripture makes substantial use of or borrows the moral achievements of the broader culture of the civil kingdom in setting forth the ethics of the spiritual kingdom. In this way, the biblical writers communicate a high view of what unbelievers can accomplish in the moral realm according to natural law and without the aid of special revelation
    * (Ex. 20:23-23:19) The laws of Hammurabi are very similar in some of its material to the covenant code of the Mosaic law, and came beforehand.
    * There is also possible dependence of parts of the book of Proverbs on various contemporary collections of Aramaic proverbs and the proverbs of Ahiqar.
    * Paul seems to make use of a number of elements of the surrounding Graeco-Roman culture in shaping his moral exhortations, such as in the household codes of Colossians 3 and Ephesians 5-6, along with the Hellenistic concepts present in the list of things to pursue in Phil. 4:8, etc.
